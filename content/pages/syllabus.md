Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

The course will cover the basic techniques for evaluating the maximum forces and loads over the life of a marine structure or vehicle, so as to be able to design its basic configuration. Loads and motions of small and large structures and their short-term and long-term statistics will be studied in detail and many applications will be presented in class and studied in homework and laboratory sessions. Issues related to seakeeping of ships will be studied in detail. The basic equations and issues of maneuvering will be introduced at the end of the course.

Three laboratory sessions will demonstrate the phenomena studied and provide experience with experimental methods and data processing.

Grading
-------

There will be **two** In-class (1.5 hours) exams, weekly homeworks, two laboratories and a final project. The exams will be open book/open note exams. The grades for the course will be based on the following:

Individual Work
---------------

Each student will work individually on the homeworks, projects, and quizzes.

Useful Readings
---------------

There is no required text for this class. In the past, students have found this text useful:

Faltinsen, O. M. _Sea Loads on Ships and Offshore Structures_. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1993. ISBN: 9780521458702.

A suggested supplemental text for MATLAB® is:

Etter, D. M. _Introduction to MATLAB® for Engineers and Scientists_. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1995. ISBN: 9780135197035.

Additional supplemental readings will be suggested throughout the term.
